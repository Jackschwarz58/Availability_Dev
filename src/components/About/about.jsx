          Availability is a stylish and modern way for people to share their
          availability with others. Whether you are a group of friends planning
          a night out, a college club trying to figure out when to meet, or a
          family trying to get their schedules in line, Availability is a great
          way to make sure everyone is on the same page.

        <p className="simple-p-text thinner-text">
          Availability is designed to be easy-to-use and convienent, eveything
          is front and center with no hidden away settings or functionality.
          Every event has its own unique ID that makes it easy to share and easy
          for others to contribute too. In addition, you can customize event
          pages with a custom name and custom header image, allowing you to put
          your personal stamp on your page.

          Availability was made by a student at The University of Oklahoma who
          was frustrated by the lack of a modern web application intended to
          help get a group of peoples schedules in order. This is still a work
          in progress and any feedback would be greatly appreciated. If you have
          any feedback or see any issues, please contact me at .
